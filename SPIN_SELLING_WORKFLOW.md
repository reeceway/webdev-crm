## 📋 Stage 1: Lead Qualification (Finding + Warming Up)

### When a Lead Enters Pipeline:

**Auto-Created Tasks:**

| Day | Task | What To Do |
|-----|------|------------|
| 0 | **Run SEO audit on website** | Use "Audit & Save" button to generate full audit report. Save to notes. |
| 0 | **Research company background** | Check website, Google reviews, social media. Find business problems (low traffic, no online presence, outdated site). |
| 1 | **Send gift package** | Send branded gift (coffee mug, notebook, etc.) with note: "Noticed your business online, wanted to introduce ourselves with a small gift" |
| 5 | **Follow-up call after gift** | Call 3-5 days after gift delivery. Warm intro: "Hi, I sent you a small gift last week. Did you get it?" |

### SPIN in Qualification Stage:

**On the follow-up call:**
- **Situation:** "Tell me about your current website - who built it?"
- **Problem:** "I ran a quick SEO audit and noticed some issues. Are you aware your site loads in 4+ seconds?"
- **Implication:** "Slow sites can cost you 40%+ of visitors before they even see your content. How much business do you think that might be costing you?"
- **Need-Payoff:** "If we could fix these issues and help you rank higher, what would that mean for your business?"

## 📞 Stage 2: Meeting (Audit Presentation)

### Auto-Created Tasks:

| Day | Task | What To Do |
|-----|------|------------|
| 0 | **Schedule audit presentation call** | "I'd love to show you the full audit results - it's eye-opening. 20 minutes?" |
| 1 | **Prepare SPIN questions** | Based on audit, create questions:<br>- Problem: "Your mobile score is 35/100 - are you seeing customers bounce?"<br>- Implication: "With 70% of searches on mobile, how many potential customers are you losing?"<br>- Need-Payoff: "If we could get that to 90+, how would that impact your bottom line?" |
| 1 | **Create audit presentation** | Build deck/PDF:<br>- Current state (screenshots, scores)<br>- Business impact (lost customers, lost revenue)<br>- Cost of inaction (competitors winning)<br>- Opportunity (what's possible) |
| 2 | **Send meeting invite** | Subject: "Free Website Audit Review - Discover Hidden Issues Costing You Customers"<br>Include agenda in description |

### The Audit Presentation Call:

**Structure (20-30 mins):**

1. **Intro (2 min)**
   - Thanks for time
   - "I ran an audit and found some concerning issues affecting your business"

2. **Current State - Situation Questions (5 min)**
   - Walk through audit results
   - "Your site scored 45/100. Were you aware of these issues?"
   - "How long have you had this website?"
   - "Who handles your online marketing?"

3. **Problems - Problem Questions (5 min)**
   - Highlight specific issues from audit
   - "Your site has no SSL - Google marks it 'Not Secure'"
   - "You're missing meta descriptions on all pages"
   - "Page speed is 4.2 seconds - industry standard is under 2"
   - **Ask:** "Are you experiencing low traffic? High bounce rates?"

4. **Business Impact - Implication Questions (8 min)**
   - **This is the key SPIN stage**
   - "Let me show you what this means for your business..."
   - "Google penalizes sites without HTTPS - you're likely not ranking for your main keywords. How does that affect your lead flow?"
   - "With a 4-second load time, you're losing 40-50% of visitors before they see your services. If you get 100 visitors/day, that's 40-50 potential customers gone. What's your average customer worth?"
   - "Your competitors with faster, mobile-friendly sites are capturing those customers. How does that make you feel?"
   - **Quantify the pain:** "At $2,000 average sale and 10% conversion, you're leaving $8,000-10,000/month on the table"

5. **Solution Opportunity - Need-Payoff Questions (10 min)**
   - "What if we could fix all these issues?"
   - "Imagine your site loading in under 2 seconds, ranking on page 1 for your top keywords, and converting 2x more visitors. What would that do for your revenue?"
   - "If we could get you 50% more qualified leads per month, would that be worth an investment?"
   - **Get them to state the value:** "So if we could generate even 10 extra customers/month, that's $20,000 in revenue. Correct?"

6. **Next Steps (2 min)**
   - "I can put together a custom proposal that addresses each of these issues"
   - "Would you like to see what a solution looks like?"
   - **Move to Proposal stage**

## 💼 Stage 3: Proposal (Custom Solution Based on Audit)

### Auto-Created Tasks:

| Day | Task | What To Do |
|-----|------|------------|
| 0 | **Present audit findings (SPIN)** | If not done in meeting, do full SPIN presentation here |
| 1 | **Create custom proposal** | Proposal structured around audit findings:<br>**Section 1:** Audit Results Summary<br>**Section 2:** Business Impact (from SPIN questions)<br>**Section 3:** Proposed Solution<br>- Fix #1: SSL Certificate → Security & Rankings<br>- Fix #2: Speed Optimization → Reduce Bounce Rate<br>- Fix #3: Mobile Responsive → Capture Mobile Traffic<br>- Fix #4: SEO Optimization → Rank for Keywords<br>**Section 4:** ROI Projection<br>**Section 5:** Timeline & Pricing<br>**Section 6:** Next Steps |
| 2 | **Design before/after mockup** | Visual showing:<br>- Current site (slow, mobile broken, low scores)<br>- Proposed site (fast, mobile-friendly, high scores)<br>- Side-by-side comparison |
| 3 | **Send proposal with audit recap** | Email template:<br><br>"Hi [Name],<br><br>As promised, here's your custom proposal based on the SEO audit we reviewed.<br><br>**Quick Recap:**<br>- Current SEO Score: 45/100<br>- Estimated monthly lost revenue: $8,000-10,000<br>- Main issues: Speed (4.2s), No SSL, Poor Mobile Experience<br><br>**The Solution:**<br>Our proposal addresses each critical issue found in your audit. Based on our conversation, fixing these problems could generate 10+ additional customers per month ($20K+ revenue).<br><br>[Attached: Proposal PDF + Before/After Mockup]<br><br>Happy to discuss! When works for a quick call?<br><br>Best,<br>[Your Name]" |

### Key Proposal Elements:

**1. Tie Everything to the Audit**
- Every section references specific audit findings
- Use exact data from audit report (scores, load times, etc.)

**2. Use Their Numbers**
- Use the numbers they gave you in SPIN questions
- "You mentioned 100 visitors/day at 10% conversion..."
- "Based on your $2,000 average sale..."

**3. Show ROI**
- "Investment: $8,000"
- "Expected return (conservative): 10 extra customers/month = $20,000/month = $240,000/year"
- "ROI: 3,000% first year"

**4. Address All Audit Issues**
- Don't sell a "website" - sell "solutions to the problems we found"
- Each deliverable = a fix for an audit issue

---

## 🤝 Stage 4: Negotiation (Using Audit Data to Overcome Objections)

### Auto-Created Tasks:

| Day | Task | What To Do |
|-----|------|------------|
| 0 | **Address objections using audit data** | Common objections & audit-based responses:<br><br>**"It's too expensive"**<br>→ "Let's look at the audit again. You're currently losing $10K/month due to these issues. The investment pays for itself in under 30 days."<br><br>**"I need to think about it"**<br>→ "I understand. Just remember, every day these audit issues exist, you're losing customers to competitors. What specifically do you need to think through?"<br><br>**"Can you do it cheaper?"**<br>→ "We can phase it. Let's start with the critical audit findings (SSL, speed) that have the biggest impact, then tackle the rest later."<br><br>**"My current site is fine"**<br>→ "The audit shows a 45/100 score. Google sees it differently than you do. Here's how it appears to search engines..." [Show data] |
| 1 | **Negotiate scope & pricing** | Discuss options:<br>- Full package: Fix all audit issues<br>- Phase 1: Critical issues (SSL, speed, mobile)<br>- Phase 2: SEO optimization, content<br>- Payment terms: 50% down, 50% on completion<br>- Timeline: Which audit fixes do we tackle first? |
| 2 | **Send contract & SOW** | Statement of Work includes:<br>- Audit summary (current state)<br>- Deliverables (each audit fix)<br>- Success metrics (target scores)<br>- Timeline<br>- Payment terms<br>- Contract terms |

### SPIN During Objection Handling:

Use the **Implication** questions again:
- "What happens if you wait another 6 months with these issues?"
- "How much more revenue will you lose to competitors while you're 'thinking about it'?"
- "If your competitor invests in fixing these issues and you don't, what happens to your market share?"

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

### Day 1: New Lead
```
1. Find lead via Google Places: "Joe's Plumbing"
2. Website: joesplumbing.com (looks old)
3. Click "Add to Pipeline"
```

### Day 1-2: Qualification
```

   - Save audit to notes
   - Key issues: No SSL, 4.5s load time, no mobile optimization

   - Google reviews: 4.2 stars (good reputation!)
   - Social media: Inactive Facebook (500 followers)
   - No blog, no content marketing

🎁 Task 3: Send gift package (Day 2)

   - Track delivery
```

### Day 6: Follow-Up Call
```
☎️ Task 4: Call after gift delivery

YOU: "Hi Joe, this is [Name]. I sent you a small gift last week - a coffee mug. Did you get it?"

JOE: "Oh yeah! Thanks for that!"

YOU: "Of course! I came across your website and noticed you're doing great work in the area. I actually ran a quick SEO audit out of curiosity. Mind if I share what I found?"

JOE: "Sure, what is it?"

YOU: [SPIN SITUATION] "Tell me, how much of your business comes from your website?"

JOE: "Maybe 20-30% of leads"

YOU: [SPIN PROBLEM] "I see. The audit showed your site is loading really slowly - over 4 seconds. Have you noticed customers mentioning issues?"

JOE: "A few people said they had trouble on their phones"

YOU: [SPIN IMPLICATION] "That makes sense. With 70% of searches on mobile now, and a slow mobile site, you could be losing half your web visitors before they even see your services. If 30% of your business is web leads, that could be a significant loss. Have you thought about how many potential customers that might be?"

JOE: "Wow, I hadn't thought about it that way..."

YOU: [SPIN NEED-PAYOFF] "I'd love to show you the full audit - there are some specific issues that, if fixed, could probably double your web leads. Would a 20-minute call make sense? I promise it'll be eye-opening."

## 💡 Pro Tips for SPIN Selling with Audits

### 1. **The Audit is Your Ammunition**
- Every SPIN question references audit data
- "The audit shows X..." → Makes it objective, not your opinion

### 2. **Quantify Everything**
- Slow speed = X% visitor loss
- Visitor loss × traffic × conversion = $ lost
- Make the pain tangible and mathematical

### 3. **Use Implication Questions Heavily**
- This is where SPIN selling shines
- "What happens if your competitors fix these issues and you don't?"
- "How much revenue could you lose over the next year if nothing changes?"

### 4. **Let Them Tell You the Value**
- Don't tell them what it's worth - ask
- "If we could generate 10 more leads per month, what would that be worth to you?"
- They convince themselves

### 5. **The Gift Creates Reciprocity**
- People feel obligated to hear you out after receiving a gift
- Makes the follow-up call much warmer

### 6. **Save Every Audit to Notes**
- Creates a paper trail
- Easy to reference during calls
- Shows professionalism
